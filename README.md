 Static Node and Express Site
 
 Static Node and Express Site is my first project with server-side JavaScript and was create to showcase my previous projects. 
 To build this page I've used knowledge of Node.js, Express framework and Pug Templates. I've created a JSON data file for my earlier projects, 
 set up routes for handling requests, set up server, serve static files and create error handlers.     
 My portfolio site has a landing page, about page where I talk more about myself and series of project pages 
 to show my work and experience.<br><br>       
 
 Changes I've made in CSS:<br>
    - different fonts,<br>
    - buttons: different border radius, slightly different hover, different background color for visited links,<br>
    - color of text in few places,<br>
    - small changes in hover colors for links,<br>
    - ease-out color transitions on links hover,<br>
    - borders of the thumbnail elements - different radius
